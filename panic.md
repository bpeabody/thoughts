# Panic-Based Development Methodology

## Overview

The members of a team using the panic-based development methodology -- PBDM for
short -- are motivated by the belief that the fate of their careers (or their
departments, their companies, maybe even the world) depends on _immediate_
completion of their mission.  A PBDM team is completely focused and will work
long hours, ignore distractions, overcome all obstacles, and accept any amount
of technical debt if it will move the team closer to achieving its goal.

The mission of a PBDM team may change at any time.  When a new goal is
determined to be the key to salvation, their previous purpose is forgotten,
sometimes permanently.  It may seem counterintuitive at first, but while
extreme focus is a key aspect of PBDM, the objective of a PBDM team will change
far more rapidly than that of a team practicing Agile or other traditional
methodologies, and it is very rare that any goal is ever fully-realized.  Goals
themselves are not important to PBDM: panic and focus are.

## Advantages

A team practicing PBDM is single-minded in the pursuit of its mission and will
not be deterred by many obstacles that derail traditional development teams,
such as:

- uncertainty
- fatigue
- personal relationships
- recreational activities
- concerns over quality
- conventional wisdom

Let there be no doubt: a PBDM team will get things done.

## Disadvantages

### Poor Quality of Implementation

Because of their extreme haste, the work done by a PBDM team is usually of low
quality and extremely unreliable; pausing or even slowing to "do things right"
is not acceptable.  This concern is not fatal: with the proper training and
discipline it is possible for a PBDM to turn out high-quality code in the midst
of constant panic.

### Discourages Innovation

A greater problem with PBDM is that the methodology prevents its engineers from
innovating: their extreme focus allows them to think only of the immediate
mission; if extraneous suggestions are provided by team members they are highly
discouraged.  The methodology pushes the responsibility for creative thinking
up to management.

### Creates Panic

Management may initiate PBDM by creating synthetic panic to motivate engineers.
Over time, however, following PBDM will sow the seeds for genuine panic: the
process is self-reinforcing.  By focusing on only the most immediate concerns
and piling up technical debt through poor quality, PBDM sows the seeds for
future crisis.

### Creates Panickers

In the beginning, a management team may purposefully foster PBDM -- maybe out
of good intentions, or maybe cynically.  However, as noted above, PBDM creates
future panics.  PBDM also creates panickers: a developer who spends his or
her formative years under PBDM learns to believe that panicking is a normal
state of being.  Over time, some of these developers are promoted into
management positions.  Eventually, not only does the organization have a steady
stream of real panics to which it must respond -- the leaders of the
organization are themselves conditioned to believe that panic is a normal,
productive state of being.

## Retention

A PBDM team has difficulty in retaining, and especially attracting, top talent.
A-level developers respond to synthetic panic with cynicism and cannot be
bullied into fearing for their careers; furthermore, they value strategic
vision and do not want to be mired in technical debt.

## Use PBDM When

- Management cannot make up their minds, and/or have extremely short attention
  spans.
- Management frequently espouses the logic of "something must be done and this
  is something, therefore we must do it".
- You are in technical bankruptcy: the team has more debt than can ever be
  repaid; panic is the correct response.
- You are already using PBDM.  Once a team is accustomed to PBDM it is
  difficult to escape.  The technical debt piles up.  Team members motivated by
  "saving the world" may find it difficult to rejoin civilian populations.  You
  are probably right to continue panicking.

## Avoid PBDM When

- Your mission requires strategic planning.
- You want to work with top-notch engineers.
- You don't already have a pile of technical debt.
- You need to complete large-scale development efforts.
- You have a choice.
